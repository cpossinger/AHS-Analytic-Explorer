# AHS-Analytic-Explorer
[Adventist Health Study](https://adventisthealthstudy.org/) Analytic Explorer

This Analytic Explorer creates an effective user interface for initially creating and comparing multiple Cox Proportional Hazard Models. This app created using the R Shiny package allows researchers with little programming to create their own models and view their diagnostics in order to eventually conduct multivariate survival analysis. Functionality of this app includes a CRUD (create,read,update,delete) framework as well as a text box to define an additional data prep function.
Included is a sample survival analysis dataset to be able to create your own models!

*note It's possible that there is a bug with the load data file button. If this bug occurs click the "Apply Data Prep Function" button and the dataset should load.
